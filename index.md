I work in **C/C++**, **Racket**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **ABAP**, **Ruby** and learn new languages quickly. I'm always looking for opportunities to broaden my skills and contribute to my community!

With Agile Development methods, I have hands-on experience developing tests and improving existing codebases at **Autodesk**, **Northrop Grumman Corporation**, and **Hewlett Packard**.
