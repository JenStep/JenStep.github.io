# Welcome!

A recent computer science grad, I'm looking for opportunities to broaden my skills and contribute to my community. I work in C/C++, Racket, Java, JavaScript, Python, ABAP, and learn new languages quickly. With Agile Development methods, I have hands-on experience developing tests and improving existing codebases at Autodesk, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and Hewlett Packard. Sound like a match? Send me a note!
